# ExtractRssWithJavaScript
I initialy had a project involving Xpaths and extracting RSS datas with JS. My only problem was that i couldn't use Jquery, i had to find a way using RAW JavaScript and i
couldn't find any tutorials teaching me how to do so. I had to find multiple tutorials to achieve my goal. So here is my answer for the RSS/RAW Javascript problem. I hope
it'll help someone.
